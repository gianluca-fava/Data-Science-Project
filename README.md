# DataScience Project - DRS and overtake in F1
This project is about overtaking in Formula 1 and the changes brought by DRS

## I tried to answer these questions:

- DRS was introduced in F1 in 2011, but what changes did its implementation bring?

- Which circuits and seasons have the most overtaking?

- Has overtaking increased in 2022 compared to 2011?

- Which driver has overtaken the most and which driver has been overtaken the most?

- Why were there so many overtakes in Hungary in 2022 compared to the year before?
